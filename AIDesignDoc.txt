 - Background
    - Importance of Swing Analysis in the Improvement of Golf Swing Form
        - Swing Analysis is imperative in the possible correction and ultimate improvement of the User's Swing.
        - Swing Analysis focuses on club path, club head position, swing tempo, and swing speed.
    - Traditional vs AI Driven Approach
        - The aim of this project is not to replace traditional methods, but rather to complete them. AI can be used in a complementary manner to help provide insight
          into more tedious aspects of a golf swing.

    - TO BE ADDED LATER

 - Methodology
    - System Design
        - Processes
            1 - Acquiring data.
            2 - Preprocessing.
            3 - Splitting and balancing the dataset.
            4 - Building and training the model.
            5 - Evaluation.
            6 - Hyperparameter tuning.

    - Components
        - Various cameras (Iphone, Canon, GoPro)
        - Processing Library - OpenCV, YOLOV5
        - UI - TKinter possibly

    - Data Collection   
        - Golf driving range (Natural lies and grass)
        - Wohali (Turf for more controlled view)

    - Dataset Preparation
        - Collection of labeled golf swing data. This will be accomplished through the videoing of my golf swings for sample data.
        - Annotations for training and evaluation

    - Implementation 
        - OpenCV Use
            - Utilize several different types of swings with various impact types (Good and Bad Impacts)
